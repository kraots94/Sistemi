\chapter{Considerazioni Finali}

Your system will be judged mainly on how it operates as a distributed system. The primary evaluation will be according to whether your system has the following attributes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item It should be an interesting distributed system, making use of some of	the algorithms we have covered in class for distributed synchronization, replication, fault tolerance and recovery, security, etc.
	\item The software should be well designed and well implemented, in terms of the overall architecture and the detailed realization. 
	\item You should devise and apply systematic testing procedures, at both the unit and systems levels.
	\item The system should operate reliably and with good performance, even in the face of failures.
\end{itemize}

Important, but secondary considerations include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Time taken to do the project (the sooner the better, but do not miss details in order to end sooner)
	\item How nice is the application's appearance: does it have a nice interface or a compelling visual display?
\end{itemize}
