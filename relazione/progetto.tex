\chapter{Progetto}

This chapter is devoted to the description of the general architectures, and specific algorithms.

\section{Architettura Logica}
Describe the components of your systems: modules/objects/components/services. For each component, describe the functionalities it implements, and by who is used.

\section{Protocolli e algoritmi}
Communication between components. UML sequence diagrams go here. Also, put here a detailed description of distributed algorithms used to solve specific problems of the project.

\section{Architettura fisica e Distribuzione}
Which nodes and platforms involved, and where each component is deployed.

\section{Piano di Sviluppo}
Since it is diffcult to predict just how hard implementing a new system will be, you should formulate as a set of "tiers", where the basic tier is something youre sure you can complete, and the additional tiers add more features, at both the application and the system level.
