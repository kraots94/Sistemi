\chapter{Analisi}
In this chapter, we describe in detail functional and non-functional require-
ments of a solution for the problem.

\section{Requisiti Funzionali}
Which functions must be offered to users / other programs? Which are the input data and the output data? Which is the expected effect?

\section{Requisiti Non Funzionali}
Everything about mode and transparencies: availability, mobility, security, fault tolerance, etc. 

Are there execution time bounds? 

Minimum data rates? If requested, specific platforms/languages/middlewares requirements for the implementation can be decided here. (E.g.: if the project is on a SOA, we may request that functions are offered via SOAP or RESTful services).
