\chapter{Introduzione}

In this chapter you describe the main problem, and an idea of the solution. It is not necessary to be very detailed or formal, but it is important to explain which are the main aims and issues from the point of view of Distributed Systems:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A description of the application.
	\item The overall structure of the implementation: how resources are deployed, which are the players, the roles.
	\item The distributed system features (and the transparencies) and algorithms you intend to implement.
	\item Your plan for testing the system.
	\item A schedule for how you plan to carry our your design and implementation
\end{itemize}
